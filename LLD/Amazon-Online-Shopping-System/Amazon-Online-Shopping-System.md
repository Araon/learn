## Use case Diagram

We have four main Actors in our system:
1. **Admin:** Mainly responsible for account management and adding or modifying new product categories.
2. **Guest:** All guests can search the catalog, add/remove items to the shopping cart, as well as become registered members
3. **Member:** Members can perform all the activities that guests can, in addition to which, they can place orders and add new products to sell.
4. **System:** Mainly responsible for sending notifications for orders and shipping updates.

Here are the top use cases of the Online Shopping System:

1. Add/update products; whenever a product is added or modified, we will update the catalog.
2. Search for products by their name or category.
3. Add/remove product items in the shopping cart.
4. Check-out to buy product items in the shopping cart.
5. Make a payment to place an order.
6. Add a new product category.
7. Send notifications to members with shipment updates.


## Class Diagram

Here are the descriptions of the different classes of our Online Shopping System:
1. **Account:** There are two types of registered accounts in the system: one will be an Admin, who is responsible foradding new product categories and blocking/unblocking members; the other, a Member, who can buy/sell products.
2. **Guest:** Guests can search for and view products, and add them in the shopping cart. To place an order they have to become a registered member.
3. **Catalog:** Users of our system can search for products by their name or category. This class will keep an index of all products for faster search.
4. **ProductCategory:** This will encapsulate the different categories of products, such as books, electronics, etc.
