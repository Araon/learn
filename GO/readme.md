# Why

If you're reading this, you might be curious about why I decided to learn Go. I've been working full-time as a software engineer for the past three years, with a toolkit that includes Python, JavaScript, and some Java and C++. I've spent many evenings learning new languages on YouTube (thanks,[sendex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVp1vrfL_w4&list=PLQVvvaa0QuDe8XSftW-RAxdo6OmaeL85M)).While working on my side project—a distributed task scheduler—I needed to write the workers to use minimal resources. I considered my existing toolkit: Python was an option, and so was Java, though my knowledge of Java is limited. That left me with Python and C++; JavaScript was not even a consideration for this task.On the scale of hand-holding to giving a live shotgun to a minor, Python and C++ are polar opposites. Go, being a compiled language, is inherently fast. It offers the level of control that C++ provides but with the crash guards that Python offers - the sheer scriptibily make sense to me.
