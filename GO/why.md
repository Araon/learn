okay so if you are reading this then you might be intrested as to why did i choose to learn go?
well it has been 3 years since i've started working full time as a swe. The things i had on my tool kit are `python`, `javascript` and some `java` and `c++`. it's been long that i've eating my dinner and learing a new language over youtube(thanks [sendex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVp1vrfL_w4&list=PLQVvvaa0QuDe8XSftW-RAxdo6OmaeL85M)) 
When working on my side project a distributed task scheduler, I needed to write the workers such that it uses very little resource. I looked at my possible tool kit, python was an option, java too but i have little knowlege about java to even start. so there were python and c++ - didn't even consider js for this.
on the scale of hand holding and giving a live shotgun to a minor - python and c++ are polar opposite. 
Go is a compiled langague - that makes it inheritly fast. Also go allowed the level of control that c++ gives but with the crash gaurds that python provides - the sheer scriptibily make sense to me.
